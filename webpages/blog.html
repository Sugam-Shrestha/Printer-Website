                        Technology affects almost every aspect of life in 2023, from transport efficiency and safety to access to food and healthcare, socialization, and productivity. It's made learning more convenient, information easier to access, and has enabled global communities to form organically on the internet. <br>
                        <br>
                        Even though technology has impacted our lives positively and allowed ideas and resources to be shared more easily, the overuse of some technology has been linked to a decline in mental health, increased social division, and privacy concerns. The rapid rise of AI tools like ChatGPT has raised even more questions about the role technology plays in our lives. <br> <br>

                        We take technology for granted every day - even when it's delivering us the latest news in an instant, making our cappuccino, or connecting us with loved ones halfway across the country (or even the world).
